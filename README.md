# tag
This is the moment we've all been waiting for... We are making a game. This is the homepage of the game we will all be working on. 
##style
this game will be text based, the idea is that the game describes your surroudings, and you type in what you want to do. All ideas are welcome
##working on the game
I will teach you how to edit the files in this game, you will all be allowed to make changes. This game will be split into multiple source files, i will sometimes move code around if you can't find someting ask me where it is. Feel free to make your own classes, functions, and files without asking me.
###splitting the work.
I will assign everyone a task such as describing the world or making items. Everyone is permitted to work on everything, but you will be responsible for your subject.
##compiling the game
To compile the game type make. The game will be called tag, so type ./tag to run it. when you add a new file, tell me so I can add it to the compile list.
